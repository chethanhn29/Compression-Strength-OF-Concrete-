# Predicting Compressive Strength of Concrete-using-Machine-Learning

# Problem statement
Predicting Compressive Strength of Concrete given its age and quantitative measurements of ingredients.

## Concrete Compressive Strength Prediction using Machine Learning

Concrete is one of the most important materials in Civil Engineering. Knowing the compressive strength of concrete is very important when constructing a building or a bridge. The Compressive Strength of Concrete is a highly nonlinear function of ingredients used in making it and their characteristics. Thus, using Machine Learning to predict the Strength could be useful in generating a combination of ingredients which result in high Strength.



## Dataset Description

Concrete is the most important material in civil engineering. The concrete compressive strength is a highly nonlinear function of age and ingredients. These ingredients include cement, blast furnace slag, fly ash, water, superplasticizer, coarse aggregate, and fine aggregate.
The actual concrete compressive strength (MPa) for a given mixture under a specific age (days) was determined from laboratory. Data is in raw form (not scaled).The data has 8 quantitative input variables, and 1 quantitative output variable, and 1030 instances (observations).
The Objective is to use Machine Learning for modeling of strength of high performance concrete.

Data is obtained from UCI Machine Learning Repository.
